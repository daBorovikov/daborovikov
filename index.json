Use Bibliography Managers One of the most effective ways to manage bibliography is to use specialized bibliography managers such as Zotero, Mendeley or EndNote. These tools allow you to organize and store all your sources in one place, add annotations and tags, and generate bibliography in a variety of formats. They integrate with your text editors, making it easy to insert citations and create bibliographic references.\n2. Create annotations and notes In addition to simply storing sources, it is also important to create annotations and notes for each of them. This will help you better organize your thoughts and quickly find the information you need when working on a project or writing an article. Some bibliography managers offer built-in annotation and note-taking tools, but you can also use regular text editors or note-taking applications.\n3. Check Formatting When writing academic papers or scientific articles, it is important to follow certain standards for formatting bibliographic references. Bibliography managers usually provide a choice of different citation styles, such as APA, MLA, Chicago, and others. Before submitting your work, make sure that all links are formatted correctly and comply with the requirements of the chosen style.\n","date":1673568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673568000,"objectID":"552e2d45f742e5b8328983f1289fb7f2","permalink":"https://daborovikov.github.io/post/bibl/","publishdate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bibl/","section":"post","summary":"Hello friends!

The version control system allows you to store multiple versions of the same document, revert to earlier versions if necessary, determine who made a change and when, and much more. Such systems are most widely used in software development to store the source codes of the program being developed.\nGIT is one such system. GIT uses a distributed model instead of the traditional client-server model. Thus, GIT repositories do not need a centralized repository: the entire history of changes to documents is stored on each computer, in local storage, and, if necessary, individual fragments of the local storage history are synchronized with the same storage on another computer.\nToday, GIT has become the standard version control system for so many developers, and GitHub source code hosting is the largest such service. Examples of projects using Git are the Linux kernel, Android, Ruby on Rails, Drupal, Wine, Chromium, Compiz Fusion, jQuery, PHP, MediaWiki, and some Linux distributions\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"4b21d5dcf3e4ccbf5460b69b359a5446","permalink":"https://daborovikov.github.io/post/git/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to my page.
